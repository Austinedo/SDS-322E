```

In this worksheet, we'll discuss some functions that can help us tidy our data.

## 1. Set up and introduction to datasets

Let's load `tidyverse` which contains the `tidyr` package:

```{r}
# Load a package
library(tidyverse)
```

The following tables are part of the `tidyr` package all display the number of TB cases documented by the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China between 1999 and 2000. They contain values associated with four variables (country, year, cases, and population), but each table organizes the values in a different layout.

```{r}
# Open the different tabular representations of the tuberculosis data
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b
table5
```

Which of these tables are tidy?

**Table 1 seems the most tidy out of all the tables**

## 2. Pivoting

### a. Wide to long

Let's focus on `table4a`:

```{r}
# Look at table4a - Tuberculosis cases
table4a
```

The function `pivot_longer()` makes datasets longer by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.

```{r}
# Use pivot_longer() to have an observation for each country/year
newtable4a <-  pivot_longer(table4a,
                            # Columns in table4a to put as rows
                            cols = c(`1999`, `2000`), # use `` for unconventional variable names
                            # Save the columns 1999 and 2000 as values of a variable `year`
                            names_to = "year", 
                            # Save the cell values as the values of a variable `cases`
                            values_to = "cases") 
newtable4a
```

Here is how we pivoted `table4` into a longer, tidy form:

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3aea19108d39606bbe49981acda07696c0c7fcd8/2de65/images/tidy-9.png)

#### **Try it! Do the same for `table4b`. Think about what the numbers represent in that table to name the variable appropriately and name the resulting dataset as `newtable4b`. Then join `newtable4a` and `newtable4b`. Note: you will need to join these tables using two key variables. Is the joined dataset tidy?**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
table4b

newtable4b <- pivot_longer(table4b, 
                           cols = c(`1999`, `2000`),
                           names_to = 'year',
                           values_to = 'population')

newtable4b

full_join(newtable4a, newtable4b, by = c('country', 'year'))
```

**Yay new joined dataset is tidy woohoo**

What if we had joined `table4a` and `table4b` before tidying?

```{r}
# Take a look at both tables again
table4a
table4b
```

Join the unitdy tables by `country`:

```{r}
# Join untidy tables
inner_join(table4a, table4b, by = "country")

# Improve how we join these untidy tables and save resulting dataset
joined_untidy <- inner_join(table4a, table4b, by = "country",
                            # Adding explicit suffixes
                            suffix = c(".cases", ".pop"))
joined_untidy
```

Now, let's try to tidy the joined dataset:

```{r}
# Using pivot_longer() on all columns
pivot_longer(joined_untidy, 
             # Refer to all variables with `:`
             cols = c('1999.cases':'2000.pop'))
```

But that dataset is too long and we would like to split values for the variable `name` like 1999.cases into two columns (one for `year`, one for `cases`/`population`). The function `separate()` can find the separator automatically:

```{r}
# Using pivot_longer() on all columns
pivot_longer(joined_untidy, cols = c('1999.cases':'2000.pop')) |>
  # Use separate() to distinguish between year and cases/population variables
  separate(name, into = c("year", "type"))
```

The column `value` does not refer to a variable. Can you see why?

And each row does not represent one observation of country/year (for example, Afghanistan in 1999 is represented by 2 rows) We need to make the dataset *wider*.

### b. Long to wide

The last dataset we created above is actually called `table2` in `tidyr`.

```{r}
# Take a look at table2
table2
```

The function `pivot_wider()` makes datasets wider by increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows.

```{r}
# Use pivot_wider() to have a variable for the number of cases and one for population
pivot_wider(table2, 
            # the values of the variable `type` will become variables 
            names_from = type, 
            # the cell values values of `count` will match the corresponding variable
            values_from = count) 
```

Here is how we pivoted `table2` into a wider, tidy form:

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8350f0dda414629b9d6c354f87acf5c5f722be43/bcb84/images/tidy-8.png)

#### **Try it! Do something similar for `table1` so we only have one row per country. Is this resulting data tidy? Why or why not?**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
table1

pivot_wider(table1,
            names_from = year,
            values_from = c('cases', 'population'))
```

**Write sentences here!**

## 3. Separating and uniting

Some other functions that can help make our data tidy are `separate()` (see above for an example) and `unite()`.

### a. Separate

As mentioned in 2.a, we can split a variable into two or more variables with `separate()`. R can find the separator automatically or you could specify the separator with the argument `sep = " "`.

```{r}
# Take a look at table3
table3
```

#### **Try it! Separate `rate` into two variables: `cases` and `population`. What do you notice about the type of the resulting variables? Why do you think that happened? Note: Add the argument `convert = TRUE` in `separate()` to convert the variables in the appropriate format.**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
separate(table3, rate, into = c('cases', 'population'), sep = '/', convert = FALSE)
separate(table3, rate, into = c('cases', 'population'), sep = '/', convert = TRUE)

# separate(data, column, into = , sep = , convert = T/F)
# 'convert=' parameter changes the data type to the correct one [aka. data type conversion] (i.e. '12' string/char to 12 integer)
```

**Write sentences here!**

### b. Unite

On the opposite, we can combine two variables into one with `unite()`.

```{r}
# Take a look at table5
table5
```

Let's gather `century` and `year`:

```{r}
# Use unite() to rejoin the variables century and year created above
unite(table5, corrected_year, century, year)

# R places "_" automatically or you can specify a separator with `sep = ""`
unite(table5, corrected_year, century, year, sep = "")
```

## Your turn!

Practice the `tidyr` functions we have learned on the `billboard` dataset. This built-in dataset contains songs rankings for Billboard top 100 in the year of 2000 for each week after it entered the Billboard (`wk1`-`wk76`).

```{r}
# Take a look at the dataset
head(billboard)
```

1.  Why is that data not tidy? Use a `pivot_...()` function to make `billboard` tidy!

**Write sentences here!**

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
billboard_col_names <- colnames(billboard)

pivot_longer(billboard,
             cols = billboard_col_names[4:79],
             names_to = 'week',
             values_to = 'scores')
```

2.  Which function should you use to split the date into three variables: `year`, `month`, `day`? Try it!

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
pivot_longer(billboard,
             cols = billboard_col_names[4:79],
             names_to = 'week',
             values_to = 'scores') |>
    separate(date.entered, into = c('year','month', 'day'), sep = '-', convert = TRUE)
```

3.  Which function should you use to combine the name of the `artist` with the name of the `track`, separated by `:`? Try it!

```{r}
# Write and submit code here!
pivot_longer(billboard,
             cols = billboard_col_names[4:79],
             names_to = 'week',
             values_to = 'scores') |>
    separate(date.entered, into = c('year','month', 'day'), sep = '-', convert = TRUE) |>
    unite(artist_track, artist, track, sep=' : ')
```
